            "Published Date": "11 December 2024",
            "Summary": "Tesla, led by CEO Elon Musk, lobbied the UK government to increase costs for petrol car drivers in order to boost profits for electric car companies like Tesla. This occurred shortly after the Labour Party won the general election and Tesla praised the party's stance on decarbonization. Musk has been openly critical of the UK government on social media, which may have contributed to him not being invited to a government investment summit. Meanwhile, Musk has become a key advisor to incoming US president Donald Trump and his wealth has significantly increased due to the rising value of his stake in Tesla.",

            "Summary": "A Tesla Cybertruck, which is illegal to drive in the UK due to safety concerns, was seized by police in Greater Manchester after they stopped a UK resident driving it. The vehicle, which was registered and insured abroad, was confiscated and the driver was reported. The Cybertruck, which is made of rocket-like, bullet-proof steel materials, has not yet passed UK road safety tests and was on a promotional tour across the Middle East and Europe.",

            "Summary": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating Tesla's self-driving software systems, covering 2.4 million vehicles across multiple models manufactured between 2016 and 2024. The probe follows four crash reports involving Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" software, with one fatal incident and another involving injury. NHTSA aims to determine if Tesla's self-driving systems can detect and respond to reduced visibility conditions, and if other similar crashes have occurred. The investigation comes a week after Tesla's Cybercab robotaxi reveal, which received mixed reactions from analysts and investors.",

            "Published Date": "25 February 2025",
            "Summary": "Tesla shares fell by over 9% after EU and UK sales dropped by almost half in January, causing the company's valuation to dip below $1 trillion for the first time since November 2021. The sales slump is mainly attributed to increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers and potential backlash from buyers due to CEO Elon Musk's controversial political interventions. Analysts suggest that Musk's involvement with right-wing groups and criticism of political figures in the US, UK, and Germany may be negatively impacting Tesla's sales.",

            "Summary": "Tesla facilities in the US are being targeted in protests and vandalism due to Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration. The protests, which have resulted in arrests and damage to Tesla property, are a response to Musk's creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and the subsequent firing or offering buyouts to about 100,000 federal employees. Critics have called Musk \"President Musk\" and are concerned about his influence in the White House. Tesla owners are also defacing their own cars in protest, and the backlash to Musk's political involvement has caused Tesla's share price to tumble. Some are also concerned about the potential benefit Musk's government involvement is having on his businesses, which have billions of dollars in contracts with the US government.",

            "Summary": "The US stock market initially rallied after Donald Trump's election, but has since settled. Some companies that have seen significant gains include Tesla, whose shares have surged by 35% due to expectations of reduced regulatory scrutiny and potential policy changes that could benefit the company. Bitcoin has also jumped by over 25% due to anticipation of a more favorable regulatory environment under Trump. Prison operators GEO Group and CoreCivic have seen gains of around 70% due to Trump's vow to deport millions of migrants. Meanwhile, shares in major US banks have also risen due to expectations of lighter regulation. The dollar index has also risen, reflecting expectations of higher interest rates and a stronger US economy.",

Protesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms, holding signs that read \"Say no to Doge\" and \"Deport Musk,\" and called on others to sell their Tesla stock and vehicles. The protests came as Tesla's shares have shed 30% of their value since Trump's inauguration last month.",

The feature is available in nearly 2.6 million Tesla cars, including the Model S, Model 3, and Model X and Y.

            "Summary": "Volkswagen Group (VW) and US electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian have launched a $5.8bn joint venture, with VW increasing its investment in the partnership and sharing EV technology. The deal provides loss-making Rivian with crucial funding as it prepares for the launch of its R2 model next year, while VW will be able to use Rivian's technology in its own range of vehicles. The first VW models equipped with Rivian technology are expected to be available to customers as early as 2027. The joint venture comes as VW, Europe's biggest car maker, is planning to announce major cost-cutting measures due to higher costs, weakening sales, competition from Chinese EV makers and a slower-than-expected move away from petrol and diesel vehicles. Rivian has also taken steps to cut costs amid softening demand for EVs.",
